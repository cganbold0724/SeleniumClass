Selenium Class 6
Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled.

Three types of Alerts:
     1: Web based alerts/ HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
     2: Javascript Alert/ browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
     we cannot inspect !!!
     3: Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium !!!
Types of JavaScript alerts:
     1: Simple alert - click ok
     2: Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
     3: Prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
     1: accept() - click ok
     2: dismiss - click on cancel
     3: getText()
     4: sendKeys()

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple vies on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

In alerts - we switch to an alert manually and switch back automatically
In frames - we switch to an frame manually and switch back to main page manually

Interview Question:
How do you handle Alerts in Selenium? - We handle alerts by using Alert Interface
