Selenium class 7

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

The original page where you navigate will be called parent handle
and additional tab opened afterwards will be called child handle

Most of the time when you interact with links they will open a new tab or a window

Synchronization:
  Is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level
  in this case we are bringing our script and page load to the same speed level

Thread.sleep() - static wait / unconditional wait

Types of selenium waits:
Implicit wait:
   It tells the webdriver to wait until certain amount of time before throwing an exception
   It will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
   We can say the Implicit wait is a global wait
   Implicit wait works with findElement() method
   Implicit wait is usually set for 20 seconds. If your element is found in any time between the given time the
   remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or to the next step
   If the element is not found in a give time, Only then ou will get an exception

Explicit wait
Fluent wait
