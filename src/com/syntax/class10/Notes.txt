Calendars
Calendars also called as date-pickers

How to Handle Calendar:
1. Click on the calendar
2. Locate the month and get Text
3. if the desired text is not visible --> we will keep clicking on next and keep updating month text
4. as soon as we find our desired text --> grab all the cells from the table
5. loop through the cells
6.once the cell value is matched with our condition --> click on the matched date
